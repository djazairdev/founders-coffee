/**
 * A member's team page for a published hackathon (B-TEAM-07): where they stand in it, the team
 * they are in with its members, and whether teams can still change, decided here from the
 * hackathon's dates. Only the captain is given the requests waiting for an answer and when the
 * team's invite link stops working; a member in no team is given their own requests instead. Once
 * the results are published, a member also reads the judges' feedback on their own team's entry
 * and where the project made from it stands (B-JDG-12, B-PRJ-02): the team comes from the reader's
 * own membership, so nobody can ask for another's.
